# PokemonFinder

This is a chance to play with Vue.JS and integrate the free Pokemon API

Users will be able to "catch" a Pokemon by adding it to their list using the Pokemon's name.
The program will send a GET request to the API for the appropriate Pokemon info and add it to the Vue store.
The Pokemon will then be added to the list of current Pokemon, with the option to Activate or Deactive that Pokemon.
